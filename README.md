Extension development can be tricky as tutorials can be based on manifest 2 instead of manifest 3 and they are simply less written about.

Some sources I've found useful:

[02 | Building a Chrome Extension Template using Vite, React and TypeScript](https://medium.com/@jamesprivett29/02-building-a-chrome-extension-template-using-vite-react-and-typescript-d5d9912f1b40)

A very clean guide to using Vite as a bundler for an extension. Includes some very pertinent hints and gotchas.
